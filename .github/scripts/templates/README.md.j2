## About

This repo contains a collection of containers which are optimized for use in kubernetes, and updated automatically to keep up with upstream versions. Using an image effectively in Kubernetes requires a few ingredients:

- The filesystem must be able to be immutable
- The container must not run as root
- The container shouldn't require any manual interaction
- The container should ideally be configurable via environmental variables

## Available Tags

Each Image will be built with the standard `latest` rolling tag, along with tags specific to it's version. For Semantically Versioned containers (e.g. `v1.2.3`), `major`, `major.minor`, and `major.minor.patch` tags will be generated, for example, ![1](https://img.shields.io/badge/1-blue?style=flat-square) ![1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.2-blue?style=flat-square) and ![1.2.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.2.3-blue?style=flat-square). Available Images Below.
